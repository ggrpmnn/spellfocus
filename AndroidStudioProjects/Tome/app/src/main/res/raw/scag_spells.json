On a hit the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.\n\nAt 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th level."
